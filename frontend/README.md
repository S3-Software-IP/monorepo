## Overview

The frontend of our application is built with React and Next.js. It's responsible
for creating a seamless user interface,
providing an excellent user experience and efficient development.

**Why did we choose React with Next.js?**

- **Seamless Development:**
  Next.js simplifies frontend development, making it more efficient and
  enjoyable for our team.

- **Server-Side Rendering:**
  The built-in server-side rendering capabilities enhance performance and SEO,
  ensuring a great user experience.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:**
  Next.js provides robust documentation and interactive tutorials, making it easy
  to learn and work with.

These reasons make React with Next.js the ideal choice for crafting our frontend
application.

## Getting Started

To run the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the /frontend folder in a terminal.
2. Use the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Use the following command to run the local development environment:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your preferred browser,
   and you are within the frontend application.

Please ensure you have the necessary packages and external software installed for
a smooth experience.

## Tests

The frontend is tested using Jest. It's an integrated tool with a relatively low
learning curve. To run already existing local tests:

1. Navigate to the /frontend folder in a terminal.
2. Use the following command to run and review the tests:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
