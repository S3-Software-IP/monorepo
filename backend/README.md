## Overview

To create the most up-to-date overview of the API. We recommend opening the
[OpenAPI specification](./apis-spec.yml) in the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).

**Why did we choose to develop our API in ASP.NET Core?**

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on various operating systems.
